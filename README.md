1. Array Manipulation
Concept: Arrays are fundamental data structures. Basic operations include accessing, updating, and iterating over array elements.

2. String Manipulation
Concept: Strings are sequences of characters. Operations include slicing, concatenation, and traversal.

3. Using Dictionaries
Concept: Dictionaries (hash tables) are used for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

4. Recursion
Concept: Recursion involves a function calling itself. It's often used in divide-and-conquer approaches.

5. Sorting Algorithms
Concept: Sorting is the process of ordering elements in a list. Common algorithms include Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

6. Linked List Manipulation
Concept: A linked list is a linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next. It's a fundamental data structure useful for dynamic size and efficient insertion/deletion

7. Dynamic Programming
Concept: Dynamic programming is an optimization technique using memorization or tabulation to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems

8. Binary Trees
Concept: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. Operations include traversal, insertion, and deletion.

9. Graph Algorithms
Concept: Graphs are used to represent networks. Key operations include traversals like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

10. Searching Algorithms
Concept: Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve information stored within some data structure.
